## Comments

### Clarity

- Given the simplicity of the plot, it is not difficult to understand the core idea to be expressed.

[Recommendation]

- It would be great to include a legend for the color bar, so readers get an idea of the gap between the darkest and brightest values.

# FBB important suggestion

### Aesthetic

- Good choice of a single color tone, differentiated by different brightness. This avoids unnecessary confusions, and focuses on a single information/variable.

[Recommendation]

- Other than the color legend, the title can also be make bigger. Otherwise, good job.

### Honesty

- Given that Bronx has lighter colors, I suppose that darker color has higher income. Some colorings on the map appear suspicious, such as extremely high income in Central Park, extremely low incomes in lower Manhattan, and highly heterogenous/dissimilar incomes in Upper Town.

[Recommendation]

- Perhaps an examination has to be done to make sure the coloring is representing what it should convey.

# FBB good, things you missed:

the axis labels are missing and so are the units. While the characteristic shape of NYC makes it ok some times to drop the frame and coordinates altogether, if they are not dropped they should be includid properly, which include axis lables ("flat plane coordinates Easting and Northing") and the units, since they are not pure numbers : feet


missing the colorbars is equivalent to missing the axis labels and ticks: the color bar is the axis of the third dimension

while the sequential color scheme works, one could consider a diverging color map, with a foral point at the average of income, giving a further piece of information by separating the indigent from the affluent areas at a glance

10/10
